  <p class="para">Durham Football Club / Durham Corinthians
    We are delighted and excited to announce the merger of Durham FC and Durham Corinthians FC.
    
    Following discussions between the two clubs, it quickly became evident that we share the same values and footballing philosophy and talks progressed rapidly leading to this merger.
    
    Durham FC Juniors were formed in 2020 but have strong roots in the City of Durham, initially playing as Durham City Juniors since 2008. 
    
    Durham FC Juniors has 11 teams from under 7s through to under 15s as well as a strong ‘Dribblers’ section introducing young children to football.
    
    Durham Corinthians were formed in 2018 with the aim of bringing men’s senior football back to the City of Durham and have progressed quickly despite the impact of the pandemic. 
    
    The club has been promoted to the Wearside Premier League and also won the Durham FA Trophy in 2022. 
    
    This merger will bring together the strengths of both clubs to create a new, structurally sound club under the banner of Durham FC.</p> 
    
    <p class="para-2"> The new club will adopt the Durham FC badge and branding and will wear the red and black home kit of Durham FC across both the senior and junior teams, as well as the blue away colours.  The senior side will be Durham FC Corinthians during the transition and the junior section will retain their identity as Durham FC Juniors.
    
    The home of the club will be New Ferens Park in Belmont.
    
    Corinthians have developed a great relationship with the owner of the ground since their formation, and the new Durham FC will benefit from this association with access to the excellent facilities at Soccarena, Extra Time Café, Infinite Air and Lickety Split, with the opportunity for club parties and celebrations in these fabulous venues.
    
    Durham FC and Durham Corinthians have both consulted within their existing structures as part of the amalgamation and feel that this is a fantastic opportunity to continue the growth of grassroots football in the City of Durham, where football can be played and enjoyed in the right way.</p> 
    
    <p class="para-3"> The merger provides stability and longevity for the clubs and a clear pathway for junior footballers into senior football.
    
    The merger will allow the strong coaching network in place at Durham Corinthians to benefit the new club as a whole and will welcome in a whole new community of players, coaches and parents as we look to progress, both at a senior level and continue to develop and grow the junior section.
    
    This is a long-term project, but things will begin to change over the summer in relation to social media accounts, websites, branding and club announcements.  We can’t wait to share our updates with our community, and beyond, and look forward to your support in the exciting new chapter as we progress as Durham FC.
    
    Richard Toynbee
    Chairman - Durham Football Club</p>
